# Simon Game

The Simon Game is a memory-based game where players need to remember and repeat a sequence of colors. This project implements the Simon Game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Description

The Simon Game presents a series of colored buttons that light up in a specific pattern. Players need to observe the pattern and replicate it by clicking the buttons in the correct order. The game progressively increases in difficulty as the pattern gets longer.

## Gameplay

1. Start the game by pressing any key on the keyboard.
2. Observe the sequence of colors presented by the game.
3. Click the buttons in the same order as the sequence.
4. If the button clicks match the sequence, the game progresses to the next level with an extended pattern.
5. If the button clicks do not match the sequence, the game ends and can be restarted by pressing any key.

## Project Structure

The project consists of the following files:

- `index.html`: The main HTML file that defines the structure of the Simon game.
- `styles.css`: The CSS file that styles the game elements.

## Dependencies

The project relies on the following dependencies:

- [jQuery](https://jquery.com/): A fast and feature-rich JavaScript library used for DOM manipulation.

Make sure to include the jQuery library by adding the following script tag in the `<head>` section of the HTML file:
